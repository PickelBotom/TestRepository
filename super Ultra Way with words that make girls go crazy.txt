1. How about taking your license away since you’re driving me crazy by the day? But, I am loving it!

2. Without you, I will stop breathing. You’re my life support through every difficult day that I have.

3. Baby, words aren’t enough to tell you how beautiful you are to me. Maybe a kiss can say it more!
